[![Build Docker Image of Python Server](https://github.com/semashkinvg/grpc-code-snippets/actions/workflows/docker-image-python-server.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/semashkinvg/grpc-code-snippets/actions/workflows/docker-image-python-server.yml)

# Summary

I want to make gRPC services in different programming languages to have those code snippets handy. On top of that, I plan to package those services in containers and deploy them to Minikube, so I have noted how to do that. To complete the dev cycle, I'm inclined to build a robust CI pipeline on GitHub actions and CD using ArgoCD to my Minikube.

## How to make a python app

from the root repostiory folder:
```bash
chmod +x ./protos/generate.sh
./protos/generate.sh ./src/python/client
./protos/generate.sh ./src/python/server
```
run apps in debug

## Minikube

### Issue: Couldn't pull image from ghcr.io
